# San Francisco Crime classification, Kaggle Competition

Here is the description of the competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime

The goal is to classify the category of crime given the time and location where it occured.

We plan to work according to the following steps :
- Aggregating the data
- Data exploration 
- Classification
- Search engine



Here are the details of each step.
1. Aggregating the data
There are 39 different types of crimes. We first decided to aggregate them into 16 categories to simplify the analysis.
No need to process the data further as they are already clean.


2. Data exploration and visualization
A descriptive analysis of different types of crimes to answer these questions :
- How many times do crimes occur? When ?
- In which neighborhood does a particular crime happen?
- Create a map.


3. Classification
Use of data mining techniques to predict where and when they could happen.

4. Search engine
We would like to create a search engine where we can type the neighborhood or time to get a statistics summary of crimes
